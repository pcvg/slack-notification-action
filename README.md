### Example - How to use?

```yml
name: Notification example
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  
jobs:
  slack-notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Notify
        if: always()
        uses: pcvg/slack-notification-action@master
        with:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX
          TITLE_SUCCESS: "Your build was completed successfully."
          TITLE_FAIL: "Your build failed."
          BODY_SUCCESS: "The build started by ${{ github.actor }} in API service was completed successfully"
          BODY_FAIL: "Failed - ${{ github.actor }}'s build failed - <https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/commit/${{ github.sha }}/checks|${{ github.repository }}>"
```

### Considerations

- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` will be used as failure and success webhook if `SLACK_FAILURE_WEBHOOK_URL` is not defined.
- `SLACK_FAILURE_WEBHOOK_URL` it is used when the workflow fails or is canceled.
- You can get the webhook URL from [Slack Apps](https://app.slack.com/apps-manage/)
